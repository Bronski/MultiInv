# Shares are now stored using a group method
# You choose a group name and place all the worlds you want in that group:
# e.g.
# groupName:
# - world1
# - world2
# groupName2:
# - world3
# - world4
#
# An alternative method is:
# groupName: [world1, world2]
# groupName2: [world3, world4]
#
# Note: Currently the inventories are saves to the first world in the list
# and not the group name... so don't mess around with the order once set

default:
- world
- world_nether
